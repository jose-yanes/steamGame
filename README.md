<h1>Steam Game Roulette</h1>

<p>Just a side project, I have found that Steam offers some APIs.</br> so I wanted to practice some node/express while creating an app that helps me to decide which game to play next</p>
<p>The idea is to gather the data from both Steam and your Steam Account and save it in mongo</p>
<p>After that it will choose a random game from your list</p>
